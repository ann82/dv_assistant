  - **Seamless Transitions**: Users can naturally mention locations in follow-up conversations without repeating their request

### Improved
- **Location Detection Reliability**: More robust detection of current location phrases prevents incorrect location extraction
- **Follow-up Conversation Flow**: Enhanced ability to handle location mentions in natural conversation flow
- **Query Context Preservation**: Better preservation of user's original query context when handling location follow-ups

  - **Follow-up Indicator Detection**: Enhanced logic to check for follow-up indicators even when location keywords are present
  - **Context Timeout Alignment**: Fixed mismatch between `updateConversationContext` (15 minutes) and `handleFollowUp` (5 minutes) timeouts
  - **Test Reliability**: Fixed failing follow-up detection tests by aligning timeout values and improving test logic

### Technical Details
- **Follow-up Detection Logic**: Improved logic to distinguish between new requests and location follow-ups:
  - **Before**: Any query with location keywords (like "I live near San Francisco") was treated as a new request
  - **After**: Only treats as new request if it has location keywords AND no follow-up indicators AND is a complete statement
  - **Follow-up Indicators**: Added comprehensive check for follow-up indicators even when location keywords are present
  - **Timeout Alignment**: Extended `handleFollowUp` timeout from 5 minutes to 15 minutes to match `updateConversationContext`
- **Test Improvements**: Updated test timeout values and improved test reliability:
  - **Timeout Test**: Updated test to use 16-minute old context (older than 15-minute timeout)
  - **Test Isolation**: Improved test setup to prevent interference between test cases

### Impact
- **Before**: Location follow-ups like "I live near San Francisco California." were incorrectly classified as `off_topic` instead of being recognized as location follow-ups

- **User Experience**: Users can now provide location information in follow-up responses without losing conversation context

## [v1.21.6] - 2024-12-19

### Fixed
- **Follow-up Detection Logic**: Fixed critical issue where new requests with location were incorrectly detected as follow-up questions
  - **New Request Detection**: Added logic to detect when a query contains location keywords (like "I live in", "I'm in") and treat it as a new request, not a follow-up
  - **Pet-related Pattern Refinement**: Made pet-related follow-up patterns more specific to actual questions (like "Do they allow pets?") rather than general pet mentions
  - **Context Debugging**: Added detailed logging to understand why follow-up responses return "no_context" when context exists
  - **Location Statement Recognition**: Enhanced detection of location statements to prevent them from being treated as follow-ups

### Technical Details
- **New Request Detection**: Added check for location keywords before follow-up detection:
  - Keywords: 'live in', 'live at', 'live near', 'live by', 'i live', 'i\'m in', 'i am in', 'located in', 'from', 'in', 'at', 'i\'m from', 'i am from', 'i live in', 'i\'m located in', 'i am located in'
  - If query contains these keywords and is under 100 characters, treat as new request
- **Follow-up Pattern Refinement**: Made pet-related patterns more specific:
  - Removed broad patterns like 'pets', 'dogs', 'cats', 'love dogs', 'love cats'
  - Added specific question patterns like 'do they allow pets', 'can i bring my pet', 'are pets allowed'
- **Context Debugging**: Added detailed logging in `generateFollowUpResponse` to show why context is considered empty
- **Variable Naming**: Fixed variable redeclaration issues in follow-up detection logic

### Impact
- **Before**: Queries like "I live in San Francisco, California. I'm looking for shelter homes that I love dogs." were incorrectly detected as follow-ups and returned "I don't have the previous search results available"
- **After**: Such queries are correctly recognized as new requests with location information and processed normally

  - **Follow-up Context**: Enhanced context preservation for follow-up questions to prevent the "I don't have the previous search results available" message
  - **Resource Query Handling**: Fixed logic for resource queries without results to properly maintain context instead of clearing it

### Technical Details
- **Simplified Context Logic**: Replaced complex nested conditions with clear case-based logic:
  - Case 1: Tavily results available - always update context with results
  - Case 2: Resource query without results - preserve or create context appropriately
  - Case 3: Follow-up with matched result - update existing context
  - Case 4: Non-resource query - preserve context if it exists, don't clear it
- **Context Timeout**: Extended from 5 minutes to 15 minutes to better support ongoing conversations
- **Location Context**: Improved preservation of location context across conversation turns
- **Result Preservation**: Fixed issue where context was being cleared when no new results were available

- Custom Tavily response formatting always includes required fields (status, resources, count, timestamp)
- Filtering, caching, and response formatting logic are robust and fully covered by tests
- Enhanced error handling, edge case handling, and test reliability
- README and main CHANGELOG updated to reflect these improvements

## [1.0.12] - 2024-06-24

### Added
- **Incomplete Location Query Handling**
  - The system now detects when a user asks for a resource but does not specify a location (e.g., "Can you help me find shelter homes near?").
  - When this happens, the voice response prompts: "Could you please tell me which city or area you're looking for? For example, you could say 'near San Francisco' or 'in New York'."
  - Prevents irrelevant or low-confidence searches and improves user experience.
- **Tests**
  - Added tests for incomplete location detection in both the location extraction logic and Twilio voice route.

### Changed
- **Voice Processing**
  - Updated the call flow to prompt for a specific location if the query is incomplete, instead of proceeding with a vague search.

### Fixed
- **No longer promises SMS immediately after giving locations**
  - Ensures the system only asks for SMS consent at the end of the conversation, after the user indicates they are done.

## [1.19.4] - 2025-01-27

### Changed
- **Tavily API Standardization**
  - All Tavily API calls now use a single, standardized function with consistent query structure, headers, and parameters.
  - Query format: `List domestic violence shelters in {location}. Include name, address, phone number, services offered, and 24-hour hotline if available. Prioritize .org and .gov sources.`
  - Unified use of `Authorization: Bearer` header and consistent exclusion of irrelevant domains.
  - All locations and context are handled in a uniform way for better, more reliable results.

### Added
- **Raw Content Parsing**
  - If Tavily's answer is missing or too vague, the system now parses `raw_content` using regex to extract addresses and phone numbers.
  - Regex patterns for addresses and phones are applied to all results, and the first found contact info is included in the response.

### Fixed
- **Test Suite**
  - All tests updated to mock the standardized Tavily API function and set the required environment variable.
  - All 337 tests pass with the new API integration. 

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed HTTP 500 error in `/twilio/voice` endpoint
  - Resolved validation middleware conflicts that were preventing route access
  - Fixed circular JSON logging errors in error handling
  - Improved TwiML object conversion and response handling
  - Added robust error handling with fallback responses
  - Endpoint now returns proper HTTP 200 with valid TwiML XML responses
  - Server startup sequence improved to ensure routes are properly mounted

### Changed
- Enhanced server startup logging to show all mounted routes including Twilio endpoints
- Improved error handling in TwilioVoiceHandler to prevent crashes
- Updated logger to safely handle circular references in objects

### Technical Details
- The 500 error was caused by validation middleware preventing route access
- TwiML object conversion issues were resolved with proper error handling
- Server now provides fallback responses instead of crashing on errors
- All Twilio webhook endpoints are now reliably accessible and functional

## [Previous versions...]

## [v1.22.11] - 2025-01-XX

### Fixed
- **Intent-First Flow Restoration**: Restored proper intent classification and location extraction behavior
  - **Root Cause**: System was extracting location before intent classification, leading to inefficient processing
  - **Solution**: Implemented proper intent-first flow across all processing pipelines
  - **Changes**:
    - **twilioController.js**: Modified `processSpeechResult` to classify intent first, then only extract location for location-seeking intents
    - **queryHandler.js**: Updated `handleUserQuery` to follow intent-first approach with proper follow-up detection
    - **enhancedQueryRewriter.js**: Modified `rewriteQuery` to only extract location for location-seeking intents
    - **intentClassifier.js**: Updated `handleFollowUp` to use pattern matching first, geocoding only for ambiguous cases
  - **New Flow**: Intent → Context → Follow-up detection → Location extraction (only if needed) → Query rewriting → Search → Response
  - **Location-Seeking Intents**: Only `find_shelter`, `legal_services`, `counseling_services`, `other_resources` trigger location extraction
  - **Impact**: Improved accuracy, reduced unnecessary API calls, better follow-up handling

### Technical Details
- **Intent Classification Priority**: Always happens first in processing pipeline
- **Context-Aware Follow-ups**: Uses conversation context to detect and handle follow-up questions
- **Conditional Location Extraction**: Only extracts location for resource-seeking intents
- **Pattern Matching First**: Uses fast pattern matching before expensive geocoding
- **Ambiguous Case Handling**: Falls back to geocoding only when pattern matching is unclear

## [v1.22.12] - 2025-01-XX
