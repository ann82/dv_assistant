## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **TypeScript Migration:** Core components have been migrated to TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability.
- **Response Handling Improvements:** Enhanced response generation for irrelevant queries with proper domain-specific responses.
- **Follow-up Question Handling:** The `ResponseGenerator` now correctly handles follow-up questions by using the stored context from previous interactions.
- **Location Extraction Enhancement:** The `EntityExtractor` has been updated to handle trailing punctuation in location extraction.

### Changed
- Updated the `ResponseGenerator` to handle follow-up questions differently from initial questions, improving the user experience by maintaining context.
- Migrated core components from JavaScript to TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability.
- Updated build process to include TypeScript compilation.

### Fixed
- Fixed a linter error in the `ResponseGenerator` class related to the `location` type.
- Fixed response handling for irrelevant queries to ensure proper domain-specific responses.

### Security
- Attempted to update dev dependencies (esbuild, vite, vitest) to address moderate vulnerabilities. Some advisories remain due to upstream issues in the testing toolchain. These do not affect production code.

### Added
- Initial release
- Twilio voice call integration
- Tavily API integration for resource search
