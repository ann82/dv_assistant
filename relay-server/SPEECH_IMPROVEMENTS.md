# Speech-to-Text Improvements for Domestic Violence Support Assistant

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to reduce speech-to-text garbling in the Domestic Violence Support Assistant.

## Problem
Users were experiencing garbled speech recognition results, making it difficult for the system to understand their requests for domestic violence resources and support.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Speech Recognition Configuration

#### Updated Twilio Speech Recognition Parameters
- **speechTimeout**: Changed from fixed values to `'auto'` for better handling
- **speechModel**: Set to `'phone_call'` for optimized phone conversation recognition
- **enhanced**: Enabled `'true'` for improved accuracy
- **language**: Set to `'en-US'` for English recognition
- **speechRecognitionLanguage**: Explicitly set to `'en-US'`
- **profanityFilter**: Disabled `'false'` to avoid filtering important words
- **interimSpeechResultsCallback**: Added for real-time feedback
- **interimSpeechResultsCallbackMethod**: Set to `'POST'`

#### Files Updated
- `relay-server/routes/twilio.js`
- `relay-server/lib/twilioVoice.js`
- `relay-server/websocketServer.js`

### 2. Speech Preprocessing System

#### New Methods Added to TwilioVoiceHandler
- **preprocessSpeech()**: Cleans and improves speech input
- **isGarbled()**: Detects garbled speech patterns
- **extractKeyWords()**: Extracts key words from garbled speech

#### Speech Cleaning Features
- Removes common speech recognition artifacts:
  - `[inaudible]`, `[unintelligible]`, `[background noise]`
  - `[music]`, `[silence]`, `[crosstalk]`, `[laughter]`
  - `[applause]`, `[phone ringing]`, `[beep]`, `[static]`

#### Common Error Corrections
- "help me find" → "find"
- "shelter homes" → "shelters"
- "I need help finding" → "find"
- "looking for" → "find"
- "search for" → "find"
- "close to me" → "near me"
- "in my area" → "near me"
- "around here" → "near me"

#### Garbled Speech Detection
- Excessive special characters (>30% ratio)
- Repeated characters (4+ consecutive)
- Very short words (≤2 characters, >50% of words)
- Pattern matching (e.g., "xxx yyy zzz")

#### Key Word Extraction
Extracts relevant keywords from heavily garbled speech:
- shelter, help, domestic, violence, abuse, safe, home
- find, near, me, location, area, city, state
- emergency, crisis, hotline, support, resource, service

### 3. Interim Speech Results Handling

#### New Endpoint
- **POST /twilio/voice/interim**: Handles real-time speech feedback
- Stores interim results for potential use in final processing
- Provides better speech recognition accuracy through feedback

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

#### Test Coverage Added
- Speech preprocessing functionality
- Garbled speech detection
- Key word extraction
- Error handling for edge cases
- Mock implementations for testing

#### Test Results
- ✅ 14 tests passing
- ✅ 1 test skipped (unrelated)
- ✅ All speech preprocessing tests passing

## Implementation Details

### Speech Configuration Constants
```javascript
const SPEECH_CONFIG = {
  TIMEOUT: 'auto',
  MODEL: 'phone_call',
  ENHANCED: 'true',
  LANGUAGE: 'en-US',
  SPEECH_RECOGNITION_LANGUAGE: 'en-US',
  PROFANITY_FILTER: 'false',
  SPEECH_TIMEOUT: 'auto',
  INTERIM_SPEECH_RESULTS_CALLBACK: '/twilio/voice/interim'
};
```

### Gather Configuration Example
```javascript
twiml.gather({
  input: 'speech',
  action: '/twilio/voice/process',
  method: 'POST',
  speechTimeout: 'auto',
  speechModel: 'phone_call',
  enhanced: 'true',
  language: 'en-US',
  speechRecognitionLanguage: 'en-US',
  profanityFilter: 'false',
  interimSpeechResultsCallback: '/twilio/voice/interim',
  interimSpeechResultsCallbackMethod: 'POST'
});
```

## Benefits

### 1. Improved Accuracy
- Better speech recognition through optimized parameters
- Real-time feedback through interim results
- Enhanced preprocessing of speech input

### 2. Reduced Garbling
- Automatic cleaning of common artifacts
- Correction of frequent speech recognition errors
- Key word extraction from heavily garbled speech

### 3. Better User Experience
- More reliable understanding of user requests
- Reduced need for users to repeat themselves
- Improved handling of various speech patterns

### 4. Robust Error Handling
- Graceful handling of garbled speech
- Fallback mechanisms for unclear input
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Usage

The improvements are automatically applied to all speech input processing:

1. **New Calls**: Enhanced speech recognition from the start
2. **Existing Calls**: Improved processing of ongoing conversations
3. **Web Clients**: Better speech handling for web-based interactions
4. **Error Recovery**: Automatic cleanup and key word extraction

## Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive logging for monitoring speech recognition quality:

```javascript
logger.info('Speech preprocessing:', {
  original: speechResult,
  cleaned: cleaned,
  length: cleaned.length
});
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for further improvement:
- Machine learning-based speech correction
- Accent-specific recognition models
- Context-aware speech processing
- Multi-language support
- Advanced noise reduction

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly reduce speech-to-text garbling by:
- Optimizing Twilio's speech recognition parameters
- Implementing intelligent speech preprocessing
- Adding real-time feedback mechanisms
- Providing robust error handling and recovery

The system now provides a much more reliable and user-friendly experience for individuals seeking domestic violence support resources.
