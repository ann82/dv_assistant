- **Fuzzy/Partial Matching** - Follow-up queries are matched to previous Tavily search results using fuzzy/partial matching, so users can refer to results by location, title, or ordinal (e.g., "the third one").
- **Natural Voice Summaries** - Voice responses for follow-ups now use the full content/snippet of the matched result and generate smooth, conversational summaries (e.g., "Here's what I found about South Lake Tahoe: ...").
- **Comprehensive `generateFollowUpResponse()`** - New function generates a context-aware, natural voice response, SMS (if requested), and includes the matched result for further actions.
- **Timeout Handling** - If the last context is older than 5 minutes, the system asks the user to repeat their location or query for accuracy.

### Geocoding-Based Location Detection & US-Only Support (v1.0.11)
- **Geocoding Integration**: Location detection now uses Nominatim/OpenStreetMap geocoding API for accurate city/state/ZIP extraction
- **US-Only Support**: If a non-US location is detected, the agent responds that service is only available for US cities
- **Query Rewriting Improvements**: All resource search and query rewriting now leverage geocoding-based detection for robust, maintainable logic
- **Input Cleaning**: Conversational fillers are removed from the start of queries for more relevant searches
- **Comprehensive Tests**: New and updated tests for all enhanced location and query rewriting logic

## Testing

The test suite uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and has been comprehensively overhauled for reliability and accuracy:

### Test Infrastructure (v1.0.12)
- **Comprehensive Test Overhaul**: Resolved 45+ test failures across multiple test suites
- **Mock System Fixes**: Fixed mock initialization issues in fallbackResponder, followUp, intentClassifier, and other tests
- **API Response Alignment**: Updated tests to match current implementation response formats
- **Async Test Handling**: Improved async/await patterns in test suites
- **Enhanced Coverage**: Added tests for new enhanced location detection and query rewriting features

### Call Ending Test Reliability (v1.0.14)
- **Simplified Mocking Approach**: Replaced complex dynamic import mocking with simple class-level mocking
- **Consistent Test Pattern**: Used the same mocking approach as twilio.test.js for consistency
- **Test Coverage Maintained**: All 6 call ending tests now pass while maintaining comprehensive coverage
- **Goodbye Intent Detection**: Tests verify proper detection of goodbye phrases and conversation ending
- **TwiML Generation**: Tests verify correct TwiML generation with and without gather elements
- **Response Format Validation**: Tests ensure proper response format for both goodbye and regular responses

### Test Categories
- **Core Functionality**: Response generation, query handling, speech processing
- **Location Detection**: Enhanced location detector with geocoding validation
- **Query Rewriting**: Enhanced query rewriter with filler removal and intelligent processing
- **Intent Classification**: Intent detection and classification accuracy

- No direct `vi.mock` calls for TwilioVoiceHandler in individual test files
- To run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

- To run a specific test file:

```bash
npx vitest run tests/twilio.routes.test.js
```

- To run tests in watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Tavily Response Formatting

The codebase now uses a single, unified function for formatting Tavily search results: `ResponseGenerator.formatTavilyResponse`.

### Usage

```js
import { ResponseGenerator } from './lib/response.js';

const tavilyResponse = await callTavilyAPI(query); // Tavily API response
const userQuery = 'find shelter homes in South Lake Tahoe';
const result = ResponseGenerator.formatTavilyResponse(tavilyResponse, 'voice', userQuery, 3);

console.log(result.voiceResponse); // For voice agent
console.log(result.smsResponse);   // For SMS
console.log(result.summary);       // For web summary
console.log(result.shelters);      // Array of shelter objects
```

### Parameters
- `tavilyResponse`: The raw response from the Tavily API (must have a `results` array).
- `requestType`: One of `'voice'`, `'sms'`, or `'web'` (default: `'web'`).
- `userQuery`: The original user query (for location extraction, optional but recommended).
- `maxResults`: Maximum number of results to include (default: 3).

### Output
Returns an object with:
- `voiceResponse`: A short, voice-friendly summary for agents like Twilio.
- `smsResponse`: A string with clickable links for SMS.
- `summary`: A web-friendly summary string.
- `shelters`: Array of shelter objects with name, address, phone, description, and score.

### Notes
- All previous formatter functions are deprecated. Use only `ResponseGenerator.formatTavilyResponse` for all Tavily result formatting.
- The function is fully tested and supports all output types (voice, SMS, web).

## Custom Tavily Response Formatting (v1.0.13)

The system now supports flexible, customizable Tavily response formatting with multiple format options and filtering capabilities.

### Custom Format Options

```js
import { ResponseGenerator } from './lib/response.js';

const tavilyResponse = await callTavilyAPI(query);
const options = {
  query: 'find shelters in South Lake Tahoe',
  location: 'South Lake Tahoe',
  minScore: 0.2,
  maxResults: 3
};

// Simple format - basic shelter information
const simple = ResponseGenerator.formatTavilyResponseCustom(tavilyResponse, 'simple', options);

// Detailed format - comprehensive information with metadata
const detailed = ResponseGenerator.formatTavilyResponseCustom(tavilyResponse, 'detailed', options);

// Minimal format - just names and URLs
const minimal = ResponseGenerator.formatTavilyResponseCustom(tavilyResponse, 'minimal', options);

// Custom format - fully customizable structure
const custom = ResponseGenerator.formatTavilyResponseCustom(tavilyResponse, 'custom', {
  structure: {
    status: 'status',
    resources: 'resources',
    includeScore: true,
    includePhone: true,
    includeContent: false
  },
  minScore: 0.2
});
```

- **Empty Response Handling**: Proper handling of null/undefined responses with appropriate success/failure status
- **Metadata Calculation**: Accurate calculation of hasPhone, contentLength, and relevance indicators
- **Test Data Compatibility**: Updated test data includes domestic violence keywords for realistic testing

### Error Handling

The system gracefully handles:
- Empty or null Tavily responses
- Missing or malformed result data
- Invalid filtering options
- Phone number extraction failures

All custom format functions return consistent error responses with appropriate success/failure indicators.

## Maintenance

- As of June 2024, `esbuild` and `@types/node` have been updated to their latest versions. This keeps the build and type system up to date and resolves previous version mismatch warnings.

## Changelog

- Updated `esbuild` and `@types/node` to the latest versions (June 2024)
- No breaking changes expected; all tests pass after update.

- **Robust fallback for shelter search**: If no structured results are found but the AI provides a direct answer (e.g., shelter name and phone), the system will now extract and present this information to the user.

### Enhanced Location Follow-up Detection (v1.19.1)
- **Geocoding-Based Location Validation**
  - **Nominatim Integration**: Uses OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API to validate location statements in follow-up queries
  - **Robust Detection**: Handles location statements like "Near Austin, Texas" with geocoding validation
  - **Fallback Handling**: Graceful handling when geocoding fails or returns no results
  - **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests for geocoding-based location follow-up detection
- **Voice Response Formatting Improvements**
  - **Guard Clauses**: Added proper null/undefined checks in voice response formatting
  - **Fallback Returns**: Ensured voiceResponse always returns a defined object even for edge cases
  - **Consistent Formatting**: Improved formatting for empty results and missing answer fields
