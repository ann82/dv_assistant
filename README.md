## Enhanced Speech-to-Text Recognition

The system now includes advanced speech recognition capabilities that significantly reduce garbled speech and improve user experience:

### Key Improvements

- **Optimized Twilio Speech Recognition**: Enhanced configuration with better parameters for improved accuracy
  - `speechTimeout: 'auto'` for better handling
  - `speechModel: 'phone_call'` for optimized phone conversation recognition
  - `enhanced: 'true'` for improved accuracy
  - `profanityFilter: 'false'` to avoid filtering important words
  - `interimSpeechResultsCallback` for real-time feedback

- **Intelligent Speech Preprocessing**: Advanced cleaning and correction system
  - **Automatic artifact removal**: Cleans `[inaudible]`, `[background noise]`, `[static]`, etc.
  - **Common error correction**: Fixes frequent speech recognition errors
    - "help me find" → "find"
    - "shelter homes" → "shelters"
    - "close to me" → "near me"
  - **Garbled speech detection**: Identifies and handles unclear speech patterns
  - **Key word extraction**: Extracts relevant keywords from heavily garbled speech

- **Real-time Speech Feedback**: Interim speech results handling for better accuracy
  - Real-time processing of partial transcriptions
  - Improved recognition through feedback mechanisms
  - Better handling of ongoing conversations

### Technical Features

- **Pattern-based speech cleaning** that removes common recognition artifacts
- **Intelligent error correction** using domain-specific phrase mappings
- **Multi-criteria garbled speech detection** (special characters, repeated characters, short words)
- **Keyword extraction** for domestic violence-related terms
- **Comprehensive test coverage** for all speech preprocessing functions

### Benefits

- **Reduced garbling** through intelligent preprocessing
- **Better accuracy** with optimized Twilio parameters
- **Improved user experience** with fewer repeat requests
- **Robust error handling** for various speech patterns
- **Comprehensive logging** for monitoring and debugging

These improvements ensure users can communicate more effectively with the system, even in challenging audio conditions or with unclear speech patterns.

## Enhanced Tavily Response Formatting

The system now includes advanced response formatting capabilities that significantly improve the quality of information provided to users:

### Key Improvements

- **Better Title Extraction**: When Tavily returns poor titles (like filenames), the system automatically extracts meaningful organization names from the content using multiple pattern matching techniques.

- **Enhanced Address Extraction**: Improved extraction of complete physical addresses from content, including multi-line addresses with street numbers, cities, states, and zip codes.

- **Multiple Resource Detection**: When content contains lists of multiple resources, the system can extract and format them individually, providing more comprehensive information.

- **Improved Response Quality**: The main formatting function now uses all extraction methods to provide better-formatted responses with:
  - Meaningful shelter names instead of filenames
  - Complete addresses with city and state information
  - Proper phone number extraction and formatting
  - Support for multiple resources in a single result

### Technical Features

- **Pattern-based title extraction** from content when original titles are poor
- **Multi-line address parsing** that captures complete location information
- **Resource list parsing** for content containing multiple organizations
- **Enhanced phone number extraction** with better regex patterns
- **Comprehensive test coverage** for all extraction functions

These improvements ensure users receive more useful and complete information about domestic violence shelters and resources, even when the original Tavily results have poor formatting or incomplete data.

## Intent Classification and Off-Topic Detection

The assistant uses a robust intent classification system:

- **On-topic detection:** Only queries containing domestic violence-related keywords (e.g., shelter, abuse, legal, counseling, protection, etc.) are considered on-topic and classified into specific support intents (find_shelter, legal_services, counseling_services, etc.).
- **Off-topic detection:** All other queries (including medical, entertainment, weather, sports, jokes, and general help requests without context) are automatically classified as `off_topic`.
- **Fallback logic:** If the OpenAI API is unavailable, a pattern-matching fallback classifier is used, ensuring reliability.
- **Comprehensive test coverage:** The system includes tests for medical, entertainment, and generic queries to ensure only relevant queries are handled as on-topic.

See the test suite and intentClassifier.js for details.

## Railway Deployment

The system is optimized for Railway deployment with enhanced error handling and startup procedures:

- **Smart Startup Script**: Validates all required environment variables before starting
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Clear error messages for missing configuration
- **Health Check Endpoint**: Built-in health monitoring at `/health`
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper handling of SIGTERM and SIGINT signals
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed startup and runtime logging

### Required Environment Variables for Railway

- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` - Your Twilio phone number
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` - Your Tavily API key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key

See `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed deployment instructions and troubleshooting.

## Enhanced Logging and Debugging

The system includes comprehensive logging throughout the request-response lifecycle:

- **Request Tracking**: Each request is assigned a unique ID for tracking
- **Parameter Validation**: Detailed logging of required parameters
- **Processing Time**: Tracking of processing time at each step
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error logging with stack traces

## Follow-up Question Support

The assistant now supports comprehensive follow-up question handling, allowing users to ask vague or context-dependent questions after an initial query. This includes:

- **Conversation context tracking**: Remembers the last query, intent, location, and results for 5 minutes.
- **Vague query detection**: Recognizes follow-ups like "What's the address?", "Where is that located?", "What's the number?", or "Can you send that to me?".
- **Specific follow-up handlers**: Provides targeted responses for address, phone, and details requests, using cached results.
- **Timeout safety**: Automatically clears context after 5 minutes to prevent stale responses.
- **Improved user experience**: Users can ask natural follow-up questions without repeating themselves.

**Example usage:**
- User: "Find me a shelter in San Francisco"
- Assistant: "I found 2 shelters in San Francisco: ... Would you like me to send you the details?"
- User: "What's the address?"
- Assistant: "Here are the locations: ... Would you like me to send you the complete details?"
